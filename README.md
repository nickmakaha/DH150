# Analyzing the World Happiness Report 2022

## Introduction
The World Happiness Report 2022 provides a comprehensive analysis of happiness across different countries, ranking them based on factors like social support, income, and health. This project aims to explore the societal and humanitarian networks within the happiest and least happy country, identifying the key instutions that contribute to their respective happiness scores. By utilizing network analysis, through comprehensive visualizations and supporting text, insights can be gained into the underlying factors that promote or hinder happiness. The World Happiness Report offers a broad overview of happiness in each country - missing out on the nuanced experience of individual citizens from each nation, a perspective this project aims to capture. 


## Connections to Literature

Graciyal and Viswam (2021) discuss the impact of social media on emotional well-being, highlighting how it can contribute to social dysfunction when real-life interactions are replaced by those in the virtual space. This is relevant to the World Happiness Report as social media usage could heavily influence a country's happiness score. Kyriacou (2013) explores the concept of ethnic heterogeneity and its negative association with governance indicators, providing a foundation for analyzing how ethnic diversity affects happiness. Tan, Low, and Viapude (2018) investigate the role of extraversion and social support in individual happiness, suggesting that countries with higher levels of social support may have higher happiness scores - this provides foundational work upon which example social support networks can be built and analyzed. Ye, Ng, and Lian (2014) examine the impact of cultural factors on happiness, utilizing the GLOBE cultural indices to compare the relative importance of different cultural dimensions.

These studies provide a multifaceted views into the more societal and humanistic  factors influencing happiness, highlighting the importance of social support, governance, culture, and education. However, there are still gaps in understanding how these elements interact and influence overall happiness; this project, through network analysis, aims to address this.


## Significance

Understanding the determinants of happiness is crucial for developing policies that improve the well-being of citizens. This project provides a detailed comparison of the happiest and least happy countries, offering insights into the specific institutions and networks that can enhance or diminish happiness. By identifying these factors, policymakers and citizens can be more informed and hopefully foster environments that support higher happiness levels.

## Methodology
Data for this project is sourced from the World Happiness Report 2022, the World Health Organization, and other various sources (WIP), supplemented by academic articles and reports from humanitarian organizations. The high-level overview involves comparing high-level key metrics such as social support, economic stability, and health indices between the happiest and least happy country. The true analysis, however, occurs in the magnification of the lower level social and humanitarian networks within each country, seeking the underlying infrastructures that may explain the varying happiness scores.

## Ideas for Network Graphs
Example thoughts for network & discussion in relation to social support/humanitarian graph
* Citizen A & B on a single graph as nodes, have rest of nodes be support structures.

Support Structure Ideas:
* Welfare
* Retirement benefits
* Veterans benefits?
* Access to free education
* Ability to vote
* Insurance


---
Example thoughts for network & discussion in relation to GDP
* Small business A & B on single graph, showing connections to possible resources and support programs?

Economic support ideas:
* Small business support (Government policies, aid programs)
* Overall GDP of countries (Could I make a node be larger based on a higher value? Have the bigger GDP as a larger node to show a stark difference)
* Distribution of wealth?
* Number of small businesses (Use similar larger node idea for higher number?)

---
Example thoughts for network & discussion in relation to Health/Education
* Create network graph of citizens A & B, have edges be access to resources

Ideas:
* Access to free healthcare
* Access to free education (could go under support/humanitarian section or here)
* Average amount spent on medical care by a citzen each year in respective country (Have a higher number correlate to a larger node to show possible stark difference?)


--- 
Example thoughts for network & discussion in relation to Politics
* Create network graph showing the political system and where a citizen fits in

Ideas:
* Discuss centrality of the network (i.e. is a dictator at the center and the citizen has no edge into the network?)
* A democratic nation shouldn't show much centrality around a single node, it should be well-connected
* This could tie into ideas of corruption in the World Happiness Report

# Analyzing the World Happiness Report 2022

## Introduction
The World Happiness Report 2022 provides a comprehensive analysis of happiness across different countries, ranking them based on factors like social support, income, and health. This project aims to explore the societal and humanitarian networks within the happiest and least happy country, identifying the key instutions that contribute to their respective happiness scores. By utilizing network analysis, through comprehensive visualizations and supporting text, insights can be gained into the underlying factors that promote or hinder happiness. The World Happiness Report offers a broad overview of happiness in each country - missing out on the nuanced experience of individual citizens from each nation, a perspective this project will hopefully capture. 


## Connections to Literature

Graciyal and Viswam (2021) discuss the impact of social media on emotional well-being, highlighting how it can contribute to social dysfunction when real-life interactions are replaced by those in the virtual space. This is relevant to the World Happiness Report as social media usage could heavily influence a country's happiness score. Kyriacou (2013) explores the concept of ethnic heterogeneity and its negative association with governance indicators, providing a foundation for analyzing how ethnic diversity affects happiness. Tan, Low, and Viapude (2018) investigate the role of extraversion and social support in individual happiness, suggesting that countries with higher levels of social support may have higher happiness scores - this provides foundational work upon which example social support networks can be built and analyzed. Ye, Ng, and Lian (2014) examine the impact of cultural factors on happiness, utilizing the GLOBE cultural indices to compare the relative importance of different cultural dimensions.

These studies provide a multifaceted views into the more societal and humanistic  factors influencing happiness, highlighting the importance of social support, governance, culture, and education. However, there are still gaps in understanding how these elements interact and influence overall happiness, which this project - through network analysis - aims to address.


## Significance

Understanding the determinants of happiness is crucial for developing policies that improve the well-being of citizens. This project provides a detailed comparison of the happiest and least happy countries, offering insights into the specific institutions and networks that can enhance or diminish happiness. By identifying these factors, policymakers and citizens can be more informed and hopefully foster environments that support higher happiness levels.

## Methodology
Data for this project is sourced from the World Happiness Report 2022, the World Health Organization, and other various sources (WIP), supplemented by academic articles and reports from humanitarian organizations. The high-level overview involves comparing high-level key metrics such as social support, economic stability, and health indices between the happiest and least happy country. The true analysis, however, occurs in the magnification of the lower level social and humanitarian networks within each country, seeking the underlying infrastructures that may explain the varying happiness scores.
